A GUI simulation of the Galilean moons of Jupiter, a Clojure learning
exercise.


## Credits

The event search; Earth, Jupiter, and Galilean moons models are
translated or (freely) paraphrased from Java code in SkyviewCafe
which all carry the following notice:

## Usage

Normal GUI operation  (from dir containing  src/... )

    ```
    $ lein run                     # start at 00:00 UTC current date
    $ lein run  [year month day ]  # start at 00:00 UTC indicated date
    ```
Text output from CLI

    `$ lein run  [year month day N ]  # list N days' events at indicated date

Developed originally with Leiningen but nowadays one can use:

    `$ clojure -M -m jmoons-events.core
